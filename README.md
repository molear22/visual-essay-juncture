## Grandpop Dennis

When I was growing up, I was always incredibly close with all of my grandparents, especially my Grandpop Dennis. Both of my parents worked, so I would often go over to my grandparentsâ€™ house during the summer and spend time with them. My grandfather would always take me fishing, or he would let me walk his dogs, and one of our favorite activities was gardening (we even planted a tree together!).

## The Beginning of His Decline

Back in 2018, my grandfather suffered a series of strokes and lost almost all of his motor skills. He had been on a steady decline for several months, so our family decided to take him on our annual beach trip for the last time. One night, me, my aunt, and my dad took Grandpop down to his favorite spot on the beach to watch the sunset.

## Last Moments

This was one of the last moments I spent with my grandfather because we took our beach trip in July, and he passed away in late August. In this picture, you can clearly see how at peace and happy he was to visit his favorite spot before it was too late.

## Grieving

After Grandpop Dennis passed, it was really tough on my family, especially my aunt and my grandmother, because we were all so close to each other. Even though we all knew he was sick and unable to get better, the loss still had a devastating impact on my whole family. The next summer, my aunt returned to the same spot we took my grandpop to watch the sunset. When she took a picture of the same spot my grandpop sat, she noticed a green orb floating eerily close to where he sat in the previous photograph. My aunt struggled with his loss, in particular, so being able to capture this moment was so special and comforting to her. We all knew his presence still remains at that spot on the beach, and being able to visualize it means everything.

## Moving Forward

These images show the importance of being able to capture special moments and take solace in the fact that even though our loved ones may have moved on, they will always be with us. The green orb may just be a defect with the camera or a trick of the light, but me and my family will always interpret it as my grandfather. Signs like these are sometimes unexplainable, but there was a reason why that orb appeared in this spot.
